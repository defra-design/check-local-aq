      <p>Particulate matter is everything in the air that is not a gas. This includes a wide range of small solid or liquid particles, some of which are toxic.</p>
      <p>There are 2 main types of particulate matter (PM), which can have different health effects:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>fine particles (PM2.5) are 2.5 micrometres wide, or smaller</li>
        <li>coarse particles (PM10) are 10 micrometres wide, or smaller (this includes PM2.5)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For context, the width of a human hair is about 50 to 70 micrometres.</p>

      <!---- WHERE PARTICULATE MATTER COMES FROM ---->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where particulate matter comes from</h2>
      <p>Particulate matter can come from natural processes, vehicle emissions, industrial processes and other human activity. It includes smoke, dust, soot, and smog.</p>

      <p>The main sources of particulate matter pollution are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>fuel burning by cars and other vehicles</li>
        <li>fuel burning by industry, such as biomass or coal</li>
        <li>fuel burning by domestic properties, such as indoor wood burners</li>
        <li>vehicle tyres and brakes getting worn down</li>
        <li>dust and soil from construction sites, landfills and quarrying</li>
        <li>dust and soil from agricultural activities</li>
        <li>sea spray particles</li>
        <li>burning vegetation and wildfires</li>
        <li>pollen</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Short term high levels of particulate matter can have many causes, for example:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>lots of road traffic, roadworks or traffic jams</li>
        <li>major construction or agricultural activity</li>
        <li>wind, rain and other weather conditions</li>
        <li>high pollen count at certain times of year, like spring and summer</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- REDUCING PARTICULATE MATTER -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Reducing particulate matter emissions</h2>
      <p>Levels of particulate matter in UK air have been falling since the 1990s. This is due to less coal burning and improved emissions standards for transport, industry and products, such as solvents.</p>

      <p>Around half of the particulate matter in the UK comes from naturally occurring sources, such as pollen or sea spray, or is transported here from other countries. The rest comes from human activities in the UK.</p>

      <p>The government has specific targets for reducing PM2.5 emissions and keeping levels low. Reducing PM2.5 will also reduce PM10, because they come from many of the same sources.</p>

      <!-- HEALTH EFFECTS OF PARTICULATE MATTER -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Health effects of particulate matter</h2>
      <p>Particulate matter is small enough for us to breathe in. When there is a lot of it in the air, it can cause lung inflammation and and other <a href="../health-effects.html">short and long term health effects</a>. </p>

      <p>The particles can enter the bloodstream through the lungs and travel around the body, affecting the heart, brain and other organs.</p>

      <p>Long term exposure to particulate matter is linked to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>asthma and other respiratory conditions</li>
        <li>heart disease</li>
        <li>lung cancer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>People with lung conditions, children and older people are most at risk.</p>

      <!---- HOW PARTICULATE MATTER IS MEASURED ---->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How particulate matter is measured</h2>

      <p>PM2.5 and PM10 are 2 of the 5 pollutants measured hourly to inform the Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI).<a href="../how-aq-measured.html"> Find out how air pollution is measured in the UK</a>.</p>
      <p>Pollutant levels are measured in micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³), which tells us how much of the pollutant is in the air.</p>

      <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-4"></div>

      <!---- PM 2.5 ---->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Measuring PM2.5</h2>
      <p>PM2.5 pollution is considered:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>low from 0 to 35 µg/m³</li>
        <li>moderate from 36 to 53 µg/m³</li>
        <li>high from 54 to 70 µg/m³</li>
        <li>very high at 71 µg/m³ or higher</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-4"></div>

      <p>How much PM2.5 is in the air at each level of the DAQI scale:</p>

      <!---- PM 10 ---->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Measuring PM10</h2>
      <p>PM10 pollution is considered:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>low from 0 to 50 µg/m³</li>
        <li>moderate from 51 to 75 µg/m³</li>
        <li>high from 76 to 100 µg/m³</li>
        <li>very high at 101 µg/m³ or higher</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-4"></div>

      <p>How much PM10 is in the air at each level of the DAQI scale:</p>
