      <p>Nitrogen dioxide is a brown gas that comes from burning fuels.</p>

      <p>When we breathe in a lot of nitrogen dioxide, it irritates the lungs. This can cause inflammation, breathing difficulties and <a href="../health-effects.html">other health effects</a>.</p>

      <p>People with existing lung conditions, like asthma, are particularly affected by nitrogen dioxide.</p>

      <!-- SOURCES OF NITROGEN DIOXIDE -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Sources of nitrogen dioxide</h2>

      <p>Nitrogen dioxide is released when fuels are burned, for example in vehicle engines and industrial processes.</p>

      <p>The main sources of nitrogen dioxide are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        {% for sources in ["burning petrol or diesel in vehicles", "burning natural gas in a central-heating boiler or power station", "welding", "the use of explosives", "commercial manufacturing", "food manufacturing"] %}
          <li>{{ sources }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>

      <p>Nitrogen dioxide air pollution is often worse in urban areas, where there is more traffic. But there can also be nitrogen dioxide in rural areas, and the wind can blow the gas across long distances.</p>
