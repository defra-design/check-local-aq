      <!-- LOW LEVEL -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Low</h2>

      <p>For most people short term exposure to low levels of air pollution is not an issue. You can enjoy your usual outdoor activities.</p>

      <p>Some people might experience symptoms due to air pollution, even when levels are low. Short term symptoms could include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        {% for symptoms in ["coughing", "eye, nose, and throat irritation", "chest tightness and pain", "difficulty breathing", "worsening of asthma symptoms", "worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)"] %}
        <li>{{ symptoms }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>

      <p>Adults and children with lung or heart conditions are at greater risk of experiencing symptoms of air pollution.</p>
      <p>Follow your doctor's usual advice about physically demanding activities and managing your condition.</p>
      <p>Consider the impact of other triggers on your symptoms - for example, high pollen outside or poor air quality indoors.</p>
      <p>Follow your agreed management plan if you have one - for example, an asthma action plan. Ask your doctor for a plan if you want one.</p>
