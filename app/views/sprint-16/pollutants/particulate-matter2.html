      <p>Particulate matter (PM) are small particles of solids or liquids that are in the air. The particles are only 2.5 micrometres in diameter. For context, the width of a human hair is 50 to 70 micrometres.</p>
      <p>PM2.5 particles may include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>dust</li>
        <li>soot</li>
        <li>smoke</li>
        <li>drops of liquid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Due to the small size of these particles, some may enter the bloodstream and travel around the body. For example, entering the heart, brain and other organs.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Sources of PM2.5</h2>
      <p>Particulate matter can come from nature, human activity, and industrial processes. The main sources of particulate matter are from: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>burning of fuel by vehicles, industry and domestic properties</li>
        <li>wear of tyres and brakes</li>
        <li>wind blown soil and dust</li>
        <li>sea spray particles</li>
        <li>burning vegetation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In 2022, 18 per cent of total PM2.5 emissions in the UK were from road transport. Road transport emissions are made up of both exhaust emissions and non-exhaust emissions (brake, tyre and road wear).</p>
