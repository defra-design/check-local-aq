<p>For most people, short term exposure to moderate levels of air pollution is not an issue. Continue your usual outdoor activities.
</p>

<p>However, some people may experience symptoms of exposure to air pollution. These can start within hours or several days after exposure.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Advice for everyone</h3>

<p>You should always try to reduce your exposure to air pollution, but especially if you're experiencing symptoms like:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>coughing</li> 
    <li>eye, nose, and throat irritation</li> 
    <li>difficulty breathing, chest tightness and pain</li>
    <li>worse symptoms of existing lung and heart conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Advice for people with lung or heart conditions, and older people</h3>

<p>You should consider doing lighter exercise and fewer physically demanding activities while air pollution is moderate. This is particularly important for outdoor activities, or if symptoms get worse.</p>

<p>When air pollution is moderate, people with asthma should be prepared to use their reliever inhaler.</p>

<p>Follow your agreed health management plan – for example, an asthma action plan. Ask your doctor or nurse for a plan if you do not have one.</p>

<p>You should also consider other triggers for your symptoms, even when measured air pollution levels are lower. For example, high pollen levels or poor indoor air quality.</p>
