<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>coughing</li> 
    <li>eye, nose, and throat irritation</li> 
    <li>chest tightness and pain</li>
    <li>difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>worsening of heart-related symptoms, such as heart palpitations</li>
    <li>worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Symptoms could start within hours or several days after exposure to air pollution.</p>

<p>Speak to your doctor or nurse if:</p>

    <li>you have new symptoms</li> 
    <li>your symptoms get worse</li> 
    <li>your symptoms do not get better after a week</li>
</ul>

<p>Also consider the impact of other triggers on your symptoms – for example, high pollen outside or poor air quality indoors.</p>
