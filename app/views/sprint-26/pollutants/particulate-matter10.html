      <p>Particulate matter (PM) are small particles of solids or liquids that are in the air. The particles are only 10 micrometres in diameter. For context, the width of a human hair is 50 to 70 micrometres.
      </p>
      <p>Due to the small size of these particles, some may enter the bloodstream and travel around the body. For example, entering the heart, lungs and other organs.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Sources of PM10</h2>
      <p>Particulate matter can come from nature, human activity, and industrial processes. The main sources of particulate matter are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        {% for sources in ["dust from construction sites", "dust from landfills", "dust from agriculture", "wildfires", "pollen", "power plants", "vehicles"] %}
        <li>{{ sources }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
      <p>In 2022, 16 per cent of total PM10 emissions in the UK were from road transport. Road transport emissions are made up of both exhaust emissions and non-exhaust emissions (brake, tyre and road wear).</p>
