      <p>Particulate matter are small solid or liquid particles in the air. These particles can come from natural processes, industrial processes and other human activity.</p>

      <p>There are 2 main types of particulate matter (PM):</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>PM2.5 are particles 2.5 micrometres wide, or smaller</li>
        <li><a href="particulate-matter10.html">PM10</a> are particles 10 micrometres wide, or smaller (this includes PM2.5)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For context, the width of a human hair is about 50 to 70 micrometres.</p>

      <p>These particles are small enough for us to breathe in. When there is a lot of particulate matter in the air, this can cause lung inflammation and <a href="../health-effects.html">other health effects</a>. The particles can also enter the bloodstream through the lungs and travel around the body, affecting the heart, brain and other organs.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Sources of PM2.5</h2>
      <p>Particulate matter includes dust. soot. smoke and small drops of liquid. These particles can come from many different sources.</p>
      
      <p>The main sources of PM2.5 are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>burning of fuel by vehicles, industry and domestic properties</li>
        <li>wear of tyres and brakes</li>
        <li>wind blown soil and dust</li>
        <li>sea spray particles</li>
        <li>burning vegetation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In 2022, 18 per cent of total PM2.5 emissions in the UK were from road transport. Road transport emissions are made up of both exhaust emissions and non-exhaust emissions (brake, tyre and road wear).</p>

      <p>Particulate matter air pollution is often worse in urban areas, where there is more traffic. But there can also be particulate matter in rural areas, and the wind can blow these particles across long distances.</p>

      <!---- MONITORING PARTICULATE MATTER ---->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Monitoring levels of PM2.5</h2>

      <p>PM2.5 pollution is monitored across the UK. It is one of the 5 pollutants used in the <a href="../how-aq-measured.html">DAQI scale</a>.</p>
      <p>The DAQI scale helps explain the short term risk of air pollution. It measures low, moderate, high and very high levels of pollutants in the air. Pollutants are measured in micrograms per cubic metre (µgm³). </p>

      <p>PM2.5 pollution is considered:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>low from 0 to 35 µg/m³</li>
        <li>moderate from 36 to 53 µg/m³</li>
        <li>high from 54 to 70 µg/m³</li>
        <li>very high at 71 µg/m³ or higher</li>
      </ul>

      <p>How much PM2.5 is in the air at each level of the DAQI scale:</p>
