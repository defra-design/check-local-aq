      <p>Sulphur dioxide is colourless gas with an irritating, strong odour. It causes health effects if you come into contact with it, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>by breathing it in</li>
        <li>by eating or drinking it</li>
        <li>through skin contact</li>
      </ul>

      <!---- HEALTH EFFECTS SULPHUR ---->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Health effects of sulphur dioxide</h2>

      <p>Breathing in sulphur dioxide can cause irritation of the nose and throat. It is associated with asthma and chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the airways in the lungs).</p>

      <p>Skin contact with sulphur dioxide causes stinging pain, blisters and skin redness. Sulphur dioxide can also irritate the eyes and cause eye watering.</p>

      <p>Acute exposure to high levels of sulphur dioxide can cause:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>nausea, stomach pain and vomiting</li>
        <li>corrosive damage to the airways and lungs</li>
        <li>eye irritation and blindness</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Long term exposure to high levels of sulphur dioxide can lead to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>reduced lung function and breathing problems</li>
        <li>altered sense of smell</li>
        <li>getting more respiratory infections</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- SOURCES OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where sulphur dioxide comes from</h2>

      <p>Sulphur dioxide is released when fuels are burned, both in industry and in households.</p>

      <p>The main sources of sulphur dioxide are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        {% for sources in ["fuel burning by cars and other vehicles", "fuel burning by domestic properties, such as indoor wood burners",
"burning natural gas, for example in a power station or household boiler", "coal burning power stations", "oil refineries", "commercial and food manufacturing"] %}
          <li>{{ sources }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>

      <p>Sulphur dioxide can also be released by natural processes, for example forest fires and volcanic eruptions.</p>

      <!---- HOW Sulphur IS MEASURED ---->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How sulphur dioxide is measured</h2>

      <p>Find out <a href="../how-aq-measured.html">how air pollution is measured and predicted</a>.</p>

      <p>Sulphur dioxide pollution is considered:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>low from 0 to 200 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³)</li>
        <li>moderate from 201 to 400 µg/m³</li>
        <li>high from 401 to 600 µg/m³</li>
        <li>very high at 601 µg/m³ or higher</li>
      </ul>
