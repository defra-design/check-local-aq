<h3>Short term air pollution exposure</h3>

<p>Short term exposure (over hours or days) can cause a range of health impacts, including:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>coughing</li> 
    <li>eye, nose, and throat irritation</li> 
    <li>chest tightness and pain</li>
    <li>difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>worsening of asthma symptoms</li>
    <li>worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
</ul>

<p>Symptoms could appear within hours or several days later.</p>
<p>Monitor your symptoms for at least a week and speak to the doctor if you do not feel better.</p>

<p>Consider the impact of other triggers on your symptoms - for example, high pollen outside or poor air quality indoors.</p>

<h3>Advice for adults and children with lung or heart conditions, and older people</h3>

<p>You should adapt physically demanding activities outdoors, especially if your symptoms get worse.</p>

<p>Follow your agreed management plan if you have one - for example, an asthma action plan. Ask your doctor or nurse for a plan if you do not have one.</p>
