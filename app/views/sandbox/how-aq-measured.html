      <p>The air quality information you will find on this Check air quality service is either a daily forecast or hourly information measured from monitoring stations around the UK.  </p>
      <p>The forecasts and monitoring station data use the Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) that is designed to show complex air quality information on a simple 10-point scale. </p>
      <p>The air quality information on this service is based on 5 pollutants that can have an impact on your health:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>ozone</li>
          <li>nitrogen dioxide </li>
          <li>sulphur dioxide</li>
          <li>PM2.5</li>
          <li>PM10</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-6"></div>

      <!-- DAQI -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        The Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) 
      </h2>

      <p>The DAQI uses a combination of numbers (1-10), words (low, moderate, high and very high) and colours (green, yellow, red and purple) to communicate the levels of pollution expected.</p>
      <p>Each DAQI level has health advice for the public, as well as information for people with health conditions that might make them more sensitive to air pollution.</p>
      <p>Find out how you can take to reduce your exposure to air pollution.</p>

      <!-- FORECAST -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Forecast information 
      </h2>
      
      <p>The Met Office supplies a daily air quality forecast for Defra.</p>
      <p>The forecast is updated every morning for today, tomorrow and the next 3 days.</p>
      <p>Today's forecast is valid until midnight. The forecast for tomorrow and subsequent days are valid for 24hr periods from midnight to midnight.</p>
      <p>These provide a good outlook of likely future events. As with weather forecasts, air quality forecasts are more uncertain for longer forecast periods.</p>
      <p>By searching for your postcode you can see air quality forecasts for the locations you're most interested in.  </p>
      <p>The Met Office weather forecast and climate prediction model has been developed to include air quality forecasting in a new model configuration called AQUM. </p>
      <p>The forecast is improved by incorporating recent observations of air quality from across the UK from the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN). </p>

    <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-6"></div>

      <!-- MONITORING STATIONS -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Hourly information from monitoring stations  
      </h2>
      
      <p>The Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) is the UK's largest automatic monitoring network.  </p>
      <p>It includes automatic air quality monitoring stations that provide high resolution hourly information that is communicated rapidly to the public, using a wide range of electronic, media and web platforms.</p>
      <p>There are 5,000 rural and urban monitoring station locations across the UK.</p>
      <p>You might have a monitoring station nearby. There could be several in your region. There might not be any monitoring stations close to you that can capture conditions local to you.</p>
      <p>Even if a monitoring station seems far away, the Check air quality service will display monitoring stations relevant to the location or postcode you enter.</p>
      <p>Some pollutants travel far because of their nature or because they are carried by weather conditions. Monitoring stations in your region can be good indicators of the pollution level in your area, even if it seems far away.</p>
